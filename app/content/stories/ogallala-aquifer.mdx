    ### Groundwater and Irrigation

    ##### Largest U.S. groundwater resource is rapidly depleting
    
    The Ogallala Aquifer provides over 30% of the water for irrigation used in the country. However, overuse is rapidly depleting this aquifer, threatening those who depend on this resource.

    ##### Declining Water Levels

    Groundwater levels have declined as irrigation and agriculture have intensified in the region.

    ### Impacts on the Aquifer

    ##### Groundwater depletion is captured by LIS
   
    Storage depletion modeled by assimilating GRACE observations within the Land Information System (LIS) matches well with USGS observations.

    ##### Contrasting Management Impacts in the Northern and Southern Ogallala
   
    For the Northern Ogallala, sufficient precipitation helps prevent the depletion of the aquifer caused by  water withdrawals.
    
    Without assimilating GRACE observations, the model tends to underestimate groundwater recharge. So, assimilation is essential to capture water storage recovery after the 2012 drought.

    <Prose>
    In contrast, for the Southern Ogallala, severe groundwater depletion is observed due to pumping.
    
    Assimilating GRACE TWS and MODIS LAI contributes to a **better estimation of irrigation withdrawal** and captures its impact on long-term water storage decline.

    ### Conclusions

    Remote sensing data from GRACE, MODIS, and GPM plays a **key role in understanding changes in the Ogallala Aquifer** fromirrigation and other uses.
    
    Decline in groundwater storage in the Southern Ogallala Aquifer is well-captured by leveraging **NASA models and datasets**.
