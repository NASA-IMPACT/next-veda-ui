    ### Introduction

    The Northern Great Plains region is increasingly experiencing **flash droughts** - those with more rapid onset and intensification. 
    
    Here we compare two such flash droughts by incorporating remote sensing observations from GPM, MODIS, SMAP, and AMSR2 within the Land Information System (LIS) framework.

    ### Drought Overview 

    In July 2017, 'exceptional' drought conditions spread over the region, resulting in the most devastating flash drought of recent times. The drought of Summer 2016, with lower severity and shorter duration, also impacted farmers and agriculture around the Black Hills of South Dakota.

    ##### What Triggered the Two Droughts?
    
    In 2017, the unusually low precipitation during the normally rainy season resulted in a very rapid onset of drought conditions.

    ### Extreme Heat Triggered the 2016 Drought 
    In contrast, the 2016 flash drought was mainly a consequence of an **extreme heat-wave** that started in early March.

  ### Unusually Dry Soils in 2017

  Below-average precipitation during May-July of 2017 led to **rapid depletion of soil moisture**, causing an exceptional _**precipitation-deficit-driven**_ flash drought in the region.

  ### High Evaporative Demands in 2016

  In contrast, abnormally high temperatures led to **increased evaporative demands at the onset** (compared to 2017), resulting in a _**heat-wave-driven**_ flash drought of 2016.

    ### Aftermath of the Droughts

    The aftermath of the 2017 drought severely damaged field crops like wheat, sparked massive wildfires, and compromised water resources.

    According to NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information, an estimated $2.7 billion of economic losses resulted from the 2017 Northern Great Plains drought.

    ### Damaged Crops 
    
    2017 drought also caused extensive impacts to agriculture. Field crops including wheat were severely damaged.
    
    Data from USDA reveals 30% lower production of wheat in 2017 compared to the five-year average.

    ### Conclusions
    
    Integrating datasets from **GPM, MODIS, AMSR2, and SMAP is necessary** to capture a more complete evolution of droughts.
    
    Remote sensing datasets also help capture the impacts of flash droughts on **agriculture and post-drought wildfires**.
