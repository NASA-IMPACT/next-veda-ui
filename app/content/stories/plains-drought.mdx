    The Northern Great Plains region is increasingly experiencing **flash droughts** - those with more rapid onset and intensification. Here we compare two such flash droughts by incorporating remote sensing observations from GPM, MODIS, SMAP, and AMSR2 within the Land Information System (LIS) framework.

    ### Drought Overview 

    In July 2017, 'exceptional' drought conditions spread over the region, resulting in the most devastating flash drought of recent times. The drought of Summer 2016, with lower severity and shorter duration, also impacted farmers and agriculture around the Black Hills of South Dakota.

    Considering potential impacts of drought to agriculture, economies and ecosystems, a better understanding of **how droughts evolve is critical for decision-makers**.

    ### Drought Mechanism

    The onset and evolution of a flash drought typically follows this sequence of events:
