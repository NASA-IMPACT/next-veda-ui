        Jonah had always known Lahaina's summers to be dry, but this one felt different. The grass behind his house crunched underfoot, and the gulch near the road had been bone-dry for weeks. Fires were a known risk, but this year, the land seemed to be holding its breath, waiting.

        He first heard about the winds on the weather channel‚Äîgusts over 60 miles an hour, stirred by a pressure gradient from a hurricane spinning hundreds of miles to the south. They called it a ‚Äúgap wind,‚Äù the kind that funnels between Maui and Moloka‚Äòi. The kind that doesn‚Äôt let go. The forecast said the pattern might hold through the week. Jonah didn‚Äôt think much of it at the time.

        Then came the reports of a small brush fire near Lahainaluna Road. The news said it was out, and Jonah believed it. Fires happened. They got handled. He headed to work at the resort like usual, and Mia, his 16-year-old daughter, texted to say she was going to her friend Leila‚Äôs house.

        But by early afternoon on August 8, the wind returned‚Äîand this time, so did the fire.

        Fueled by dry hillsides and gusts that topped 67 miles per hour, the blaze moved fast. Too fast. Jonah would later hear it described as the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. But in the moment, all he knew was that roads were closing, the sky was darkening, the power was flickering, and he couldn‚Äôt reach Mia. Cell towers were already failing. The line went dead mid-call.

        She was on the other side of the fire line. He had no idea if she got out.

        The next morning, Jonah was allowed back into Lahaina. The town was unrecognizable. He walked street after street, passing charred cars and collapsed buildings. He moved toward where Leila's house once stood, hoping for a sign of Mia.

        Even a day later, the air was thick with smoke. Jonah's lungs burned as he searched, wearing a mask handed to him by a volunteer. At a shelter, someone mentioned seeing Mia, but she had already left. The uncertainty was suffocating.

        Two days later, Jonah found Mia with Leila's family. She had no phone, no charger, and no way to contact him. They embraced, the weight of the past days finally lifting. Amid the ashes, they found each other.
