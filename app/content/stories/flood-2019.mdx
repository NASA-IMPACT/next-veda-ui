    This case study is powered by incorporating Earth observations of precipitation from GPM, soil moisture from SMAP, snow depth from AMSR2, and leaf area index from MODIS, and MERRA-2 reanalysis within the Land Information System (LIS) framework.

    ##### Soggy Soils, Frozen Soils

    Across much of the Midwest and Northern Plains, soils were saturated throughout the fall and winter, especially in the Corn Belt.

    ##### Spring Flooding

    The extent of 2019 flooding can be seen over the Missouri River near Omaha, NE when compared with another MODIS-captured scene from 2015.

    ##### Rapid Snowmelt

    The rain-on-snow event on the unusually deep snowpack caused rapid snowmelt which intensified spring flooding.

    The rapid melting of the deep snowpack in mid-March was captured by assimilating snow depth observations from AMSR2 within the LIS framework.
