    ##### Soggy Soils, Frozen Soils

    Across much of the Midwest and Northern Plains, soils were saturated throughout the fall and winter, especially in the Corn Belt.

    ##### Rapid Snowmelt

    The rain-on-snow event on the unusually deep snowpack caused rapid snowmelt which intensified spring flooding.

    The rapid melting of the deep snowpack in mid-March was captured by assimilating snow depth observations from AMSR2 within the LIS framework.

    ##### Record Flooding

    Rapid snowmelt and heavy rainfall resulted in **record streamflows** in spring and summer.

    ##### Soils Too Wet To Plant

    Wet soil conditions persisted months after the flooding, leaving farmers with no option but to wait for soils to dry out.
    
    Assimilating downscaled soil moisture from SMAP captures the wet conditions persisting in late-May to early-June.

    ### Agricultural Impacts

    ##### Planting Delays Cause Major Farming losses

    The Midwest 2019 flood coincided with the corn and soybean planting season, causing many farmers to delay planting their crops, switch crops, or not plant at all.

    According to the American Farm Bureau Federation, farm subsidies made up 40% of farm income in 2019 â€” $33 billion out of an expected $88 billion total.

    ##### Earth Observations Show Delayed Planting

    The abnormally low leaf area index (LAI) from MODIS captures delayed planting in the Cornbelt region.

    ##### Farmers Planted Fewer Acres

    According to USDA 2019 Crop Data, the planted fields were reduced by around 12% compared to the five-year average for corn and soybean.

    ### Conclusions

    The simultaneous use of datasets from **GPM, MODIS, AMSR2, and SMAP** is necessary to capture the causes and extent of the flooding, as well as its impacts on agriculture.
    
    Using **Earth observations to model and understand extreme events** improves our ability to better manage water resources, plan for and respond to disasters, and assess food production and security across the globe.
