    Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a common air pollutant primarily emitted from the burning of fossil fuels in cars and power plants. Lower to the ground, nitrogen dioxide can directly irritate the lungs and contributes to the production of particulate pollution and smog when it reacts with sunlight.

    During the COVID-19 pandemic, scientists have observed considerable decreases in nitrogen dioxide levels around the world. These decreases are predominantly associated with changing human behavior in response to the spread of COVID-19. As communities worldwide have implemented lockdown restrictions in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus, the reduction in human transportation activity has resulted in less NO2 being emitted into the atmosphere.

    These changes are particularly apparent over large urban areas and economic corridors, which typically have high levels of automobile traffic, airline flights, and other related activity.

    NASA has observed subsequent rebounds in nitrogen dioxide levels as the lockdown restrictions ease.
